# Herdr connection

Type `herdr` in a Termai terminal on a local or SSH machine to save and open its
Herdr host automatically. Named sessions support `herdr --session NAME` and
`herdr session attach NAME`. Command capture reads the final Readline buffer, so
history, completion and pasted commands work too. Help, API commands, shell
operators, aliases and functions retain their normal shell behavior.

A plain launch starts an absent headless server, matching normal Herdr startup.
Manual **Connection → Herdr** profiles select a backend and optional session and
connect to an existing server. Closing a view keeps Herdr and its agents running.

SSH discovery reuses the source terminal's authenticated transport to forward
Herdr's Unix socket. OpenSSH must allow Unix socket forwarding. Keep that source
terminal open while using its Herdr view. After a backend restart, reconnect the
source host and run `herdr` again; the saved host is reused.

## Terminal interface and mobile sizing

Every selected agent opens the same terminal.html / terminal.ts pane as a normal
terminal. Input, dictation, configurable shortcuts, IME focus, touch scrolling,
selection handles, automatic copy, terminal links and the history scrollbar all
use the existing implementations. There is no separate message composer.

The `herdr terminal session observe` or `control` stream supplies live ANSI frames.
Mobile TUI panes whose dimensions match the shared terminal apply those full
frames and incremental updates directly to the ordinary Ghostty terminal,
including native cursor positions, colors and OSC-8 links. Text updates no longer
wait for a history read. Delayed snapshots cannot overwrite a newer live frame.
When a pane joins an existing incremental stream or switches from shell history
into a TUI, it requests a complete baseline through an unchanged native resize;
this requests Herdr's repaint using the current controller's dimensions.

The gateway also reads `pane.read` with source `recent_unwrapped` and ANSI
formatting while visible, at most once every 150 ms after the preceding response.
Herdr limits a read to 1,000 logical lines. Snapshots supply initial history and
fallback rendering. Shells with terminal scrollback and differently sized
observers wrap that history in their own Ghostty buffer. In this fallback,
Ghostty maps the live cursor through the native and local widths; a cursor stays
hidden while the snapshot and frame disagree rather than appearing at the bottom.

The shared touch handlers ignore temporary scroll events during anchored output
updates, keeping hold/drag selections and copying usable while an agent redraws.
Scrolling, selection handles and plain, wrapped or labeled link taps all use the
same TerminalGestures implementation as ordinary terminal panes.

A visible mobile pane (coarse pointer and viewport at most 1,024 CSS pixels wide)
uses `herdr terminal session control --cols N --rows N` to resize that terminal’s
actual PTY to its Ghostty cell grid. Rotation, font changes and keyboard appearance
send `terminal.resize` through the existing controller. The app redraws at the
native mobile width, including its own borders, composer, status and wrapping.
The desktop sees the same narrower terminal; a PTY has one shared size.

Each terminal has one shared controller per backend/SSH transport. The most
recently resized mobile viewer owns geometry; desktop web viewers only observe.
Hiding a pane, backgrounding the app or closing its connection releases that
viewer’s claim, including while dictation keeps its transport alive. Other mobile
viewers retain control. A heartbeat releases disconnected viewers after at most
about a minute if their close message cannot arrive. When the last mobile leaves, `terminal.release` detaches
the controller and Herdr restores its desktop shell client’s geometry. Without a
desktop client, Herdr determines the remaining geometry. This integration never
uses `--takeover`; an existing external controller causes an error rather than
being disconnected. Only the selected terminal is resized.

Terminal scrollback and selection remain local. When the mobile viewport has no
local scrollback, vertical drags send `terminal.scroll` wheel events through its
scoped controller. Herdr routes these to the app’s own scroll handler or native
terminal history. Apps that own their history share that scroll position with
the desktop. The shared gesture code also preserves momentum and hold-to-copy.
Typing uses `pane.send_text`; dictation uses
`pane.send_input` to respect the application's paste mode without submitting it.
Input is serialized and validates the current agent before writing. Uncertain
input is never replayed after a disconnect. Older scrollback and applications
that do not handle terminal resizes can retain their original formatting.

## Tabs, names and notifications

Agent names use the session's actual pane label, with presentation title, agent
name and terminal-title fallbacks. Rename uses the same `pane.rename` action as
Herdr's desktop Rename pane menu. Printable labels can contain spaces and capital
letters (up to 100 characters). Desktop changes propagate through snapshots;
mobile changes update that shared label. Agent API addresses remain independent.
Top-level Termai tab names are local workspace labels.

Settings → **Herdr strip shows** switches between **Spaces** (default) and
**Agents**, preserving an explicit mode choice. **+** creates a new space with a
shell in the selected terminal’s working directory, without a popover or form.
Creating from Agents switches the view to Spaces so the new space is visible.
Spaces include ordinary terminals. Tap a selected space again to choose one of
its terminals or create an agent within it. Agent creation lets you choose a
name, agent type and directory; the type must be installed on that host.

Hold a space for Rename and Close. Drag immediately onto the left or right edge
of another space to reorder; drop on its middle to stack the spaces. The count
button expands or collapses a stack. Expand it and drag a member to an edge to
remove it. Stacks keep their spaces and terminals separate. Reordering uses
Herdr’s native workspace order; arbitrary stacks are saved in the web app because
Herdr’s API does not expose them. Cancelling a drag changes neither membership
nor order. In Agents mode, holding then moving reorders agent tabs, while an
immediate swipe scrolls the strip. Keyboard users can use Shift+F10 for actions,
arrows to select and Alt+arrows to reorder. Spaces aggregate agent status;
renaming a space updates Herdr’s shared workspace label.

Agent order, space stacks, selected terminal and viewed-completion acknowledgements are
saved in browser local storage per backend, source machine and Herdr session.
Closing an agent tab closes its Herdr pane on the server and ends its process.
Closing a space closes that server workspace and its terminals. Rejected closes
keep the tab visible and show Herdr’s error. Closing the top-level Herdr tab disconnects
its notifications. Ordinary shell tabs retain their stop-process confirmation.

Hollow green is idle, orange is working, red is blocked/requesting attention, and
blue is completed but not yet viewed here. Viewed acknowledgements are local;
desktop focus does not clear this browser's unread completions. Servers with
completion_seq report completion directly. Older versions use done status or an
observed working-to-idle transition, so completions entirely during a disconnect
cannot always be detected.

Metadata stays connected while another top-level tab is selected. After a browser
gesture enables audio, the official done/request sounds play while the webapp is
visible and focused, regardless of the selected tab. Initial/repeated snapshots
are quiet, and unfocused notifications are not queued for later playback.

## Backend and API

Default socket: XDG_CONFIG_HOME/herdr/herdr.sock, otherwise
HOME/.config/herdr/herdr.sock. HERDR_SOCKET_PATH overrides the default session's
socket. Named sessions use sessions/NAME/herdr.sock below the same config
directory. Discovery resolves these paths from the source shell's environment.
HERDR_CONFIG_PATH affects configuration, not socket location.

The integration requires session.snapshot, events.subscribe, pane.rename,
pane.read with recent_unwrapped, pane.send_text and pane.send_input. The read-only
history API was verified against the installed Herdr 0.9.3 server. The Herdr CLI
is also required on the target host for live frame streams and scoped PTY control. Agent
creation uses `server.agent_manifests`, `tab.create`, `pane.rename` and
`agent.start`; space renaming uses `workspace.rename`. Closing uses `pane.close` or
`workspace.close`, with worktree-group closing disabled.
Space creation uses `workspace.create` with the selected space and an explicit
directory; reordering uses `workspace.move_block`.

The gateway accepts fixed actions and checks agent IDs against the selected
server. Backend pairing and origin checks apply. WebSocket tickets are short-lived,
single-use and scoped to the Herdr session, source transport and selected terminal.
SSH sources belong to the paired browser that opened them. Clients cannot provide
arbitrary socket paths or shell commands to this gateway.

## Sounds and validation

Settings → Background notifications offers an Enable button for each backend
when termai is open as an installed PWA over HTTPS. Permission is requested only
on that tap. Focused workspaces play the official Herdr sounds even when another
top-level tab is selected; unfocused devices receive a visible Web Push alert.
Alerts include the agent’s working directory and up to 280 characters from its
latest response. A passive ANSI `pane.read` supplies the preview after verifying
the pane still belongs to the same terminal. Input borders, composer and footer
are excluded where identifiable. If output is unavailable, the status and
directory still appear. Preview text is never saved in notification state.
The notification requests vibration, while the OS controls sound, vibration,
Focus/Do Not Disturb and notification permission. iOS/iPadOS requires a home-screen
web app and version 16.4 or later. See
https://webkit.org/blog/13878/web-push-for-web-apps-on-ios-and-ipados/.

The backend watches agent transitions independently of browser WebSockets, so
alerts can arrive when the PWA is suspended or closed. Each backend owns a separate
notification worker scope and persistent VAPID key. Pairing digests,
push subscriptions, watch descriptors and status checkpoints live in private
files under TERMAI_DATA_DIR; terminal output and SSH secrets are not stored there.
Rotating the pairing token revokes notification ownership. Local watches resume
after backend restart. SSH watches survive browser closure, but after backend
restart their source host must reconnect. Closing a top-level Herdr connection
stops its alerts; closing just the browser keeps watches active. Enable/disable
applies to this browser/device. Tapping an alert opens the corresponding connection
and agent, including when the app has to start first.

Delivery needs outbound HTTPS to the browser's push service. The server accepts
Apple, Google, Mozilla and Windows push endpoints, with bounded watches, bounded
pending delivery, expired-device cleanup and transient-error retries. An optional
TERMAI_PUSH_CONTACT sets the VAPID contact URI; by default it uses the configured
public backend host. First snapshots and reconnects do not replay old alerts.

Settings → Herdr terminal layout defaults to Reflow text for desktop web viewers.
Full width preserves the server’s current column count for apps with borders,
tables or columns, with sideways panning through the shared TerminalGestures
code. Both use ordinary vertical scrolling, hold-to-copy, selection handles and
the history scrollbar. Mobile always resizes the real PTY and fits its viewport,
even when Full width was previously saved. Each viewer owns its font size and
terminal scrollback position; an app’s internal viewport remains shared. There
is no application-specific layout adapter.

src/assets/herdr/done.mp3 and request.mp3 are unchanged copies from

The upstream AGPL-3.0 license is distributed as public/HERDR-SOUNDS-LICENSE.txt;
public/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt identifies these assets separately from Termai.

Run npm run build, npm test, npm run test:herdr, npm run test:herdr-resize,
npm run test:herdr-scroll, npm run test:herdr-spaces, npm run test:workspace, npm run test:gestures and
npm run test:touch. Fixture tests use disposable
socket, dictation and SSH servers and cover shared mobile controllers, multiple
viewers, resize bounds, stale/disconnected views, desktop observation, release,
raw input, dictation, touch scrolling/copy, shared labels, menus, ordering,
persistence, server pane/space closing, creation, status/sounds, PWA notifications,
authentication and ticket scope. The native resize browser test needs an installed
Herdr CLI (HERDR_BINARY overrides /usr/bin/herdr). It creates an isolated Herdr
desktop, responsive terminal application and Termai backend with disposable HOME
and sockets; it verifies native redraw, border and cursor alignment, keyboard
geometry, desktop observation and restoration. It never touches user agents.
The native scroll browser test also needs Herdr and uses an isolated fullscreen
app with zero terminal scrollback. It verifies multi-line touch wheel delivery in
both directions, local selection/copy, plain and OSC-8 links and suppressed
keyboard focus. It checks shell-to-TUI and joining-view baselines, animation with history
snapshots withheld, incremental frame rendering and rejection of stale snapshots.
