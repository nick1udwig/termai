# termai reference

Detailed usage, implementation, testing, and deployment notes. For the quick start, see the [README](../README.md).

A mobile web terminal with inline dictation, command alternatives, and a real Bash session. The MVP uses **Ghostty `0.4.0-next.20.g1858a59`**, pinned to the browser build selected in the performance comparison.

## Run locally

Requires Node **22.18+**, Bash, Python 3 (for static Python argument discovery), and `base64`. Developed and tested on Linux with Node 26 and Chromium. `node-pty` supplies the real terminal process; platforms without a usable prebuilt binary also need a C++ toolchain and Python to build it.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:3000**. The server opens a shell in the directory where it was launched. Override that with `TERMAI_CWD=/path/to/project`. It sources your `.bashrc` for aliases/functions, then installs its own prompt/history hooks and Emacs Readline bindings inside this session. It does not edit your shell configuration or save new commands into your existing `.bash_history`.

For the production PWA:

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

The production build emits Ghostty WASM as a separate hashed asset and includes gzip/Brotli variants of JavaScript, CSS, and WASM. The server negotiates these variants and streams asset bodies; HEAD requests only read metadata. The pinned Ghostty packaging is checked during the build, so dependency updates must review the WASM transform.

The production build includes a manifest and service worker. The service worker precaches the complete app shell, including JavaScript, fonts, and WASM, under a build-specific cache. Activation removes older caches for this installation. Hashed assets use cached responses first; navigation refreshes the single cached HTML entry. The app shell can load offline after installation completes; running commands requires a connection to the host. The development server does not register a service worker.

## Use it

The terminal is always the input view. Tap it to use your keyboard or its dictation microphone.

- **Inline dictation:** the literal input appears in the real shell line with a spinner. When discovery finishes, the top interpretation replaces it. A floating menu shows up to three candidates and the unchanged literal text at the bottom. Tapping a row sends that command by default; **Enter** submits whatever is currently on the line. Disable **••• → Tap alternate to send** to make row selection only replace the line. Editing or submitting cancels pending suggestions.
- **Alternatives:** **••• → Open alternatives after dictation** controls whether the menu opens automatically. When disabled, a small dropdown beside the cursor reveals it. The menu flips above the cursor when space below is limited and does not take up terminal rows. Tapping elsewhere, pressing Escape, or choosing a row in replacement-only mode collapses the menu but keeps its dropdown available until the line is edited or submitted. Both preferences are saved in this browser.
- **Shortcuts:** the bottom row starts with Ctrl-R, Tab, Esc, a Ctrl modifier, arrows, and Ctrl-C. Use **••• → Customize shortcuts** to add, edit, remove, or reorder buttons. Each button sends keys or runs a saved shell command. Command buttons require an idle prompt; keys also work in interactive programs.
- **Automatic context:** available command names are collected at shell startup and each prompt, including aliases/functions. Internal underscore-prefixed shell functions such as `_git_init` are excluded from inferred commands unless explicitly named. Directory files refresh after shell commands or filesystem changes. The selected command’s flags are discovered in the background.

For a local script declaring `argparse.add_argument('--myarg')`, a transcript such as:

```text
Python three hello world dot py hep hep myarg food
```

can produce:

```sh
python3 hello_world.py --myarg food
```

`HelloWorld.py`, `hello-world.py`, and “hello world dot py” are matched against actual files. Multiple existing matches stay available as alternatives. The unrestricted value `food` remains unchanged. Typed flag case, quoted values, shell operators and substitutions are preserved. The supplied Urbit symbol names are recognized in dictation, including `hep`/`shed` for `-`/`--`, `fas` for `/`, `buc` for `$`, and the quote, bracket, operator and compound names. Explicitly spoken shell syntax retains its meaning and the original transcript remains available. Words already enclosed in literal quotes are not translated.

## What runs where

The browser uses Ghostty’s native terminal input textarea for dictation, a Ghostty canvas for terminal output, and a direct WebSocket connection. Output bypasses UI state and is drained in bounded animation-frame batches. The server pauses PTY reads when unacknowledged output reaches its window limit.

The host supplies a catalog from the actual shell's `compgen` output, current-directory entries (up to 10,000, with immediate entries prioritized) plus one level of nearby files within a 4,000-path budget, and up to 5,000 history entries from `.bash_history`, `.bash_eternal_history`, the live shell’s configured `HISTFILE`, and this terminal session. History readers take bounded tails of large files and refresh in the background. `TERMAI_HISTORY_FILE` overrides the default sources; `TERMAI_ETERNAL_HISTORY_FILE` adds an explicit eternal-history source. Commands observed in this session also carry working-directory context for ranking. Deterministic matching handles spoken punctuation, a small set of number pronunciations, simple English phonetic similarity, edit distance, and history ranking. Filename repair is scoped to known file-taking command positions; arbitrary text arguments are preserved. Common flag schemas are included, with Git flags scoped to supported subcommands. Git supplies its installed command and alias names through its read-only command listing. Simple aliases such as `c = commit` reuse the target builtin’s flags; shell aliases and multiword alias bodies are never executed for discovery. Multiword speech such as “get in it” can match `git init` without being collapsed into an underscore-separated function name. Discovery searches likely executable names independently of whether the rest of the transcript already parses. It reads the root command’s help, matches spoken words against the returned subcommands, and follows matching child help routes before reparsing with the newly learned schemas. This handles previously unseen commands and nested subcommands, including multiword speech, inherited global flags, Cobra/Clap command tables, argparse command choices, and usage-based command listings such as Git worktrees. The search follows at most three subcommand levels and two branches per level, with a seven-probe cap per root and a deadline for starting further levels. Only parent-advertised command names and help flags reach a probe; transcript argument values do not. Cached discovery is reused across requests. Commands with unusual or unavailable help remain limited to available context and the literal transcript. Python `argparse` and Click declarations are inspected using Python's AST without importing or executing the script. Other executables are resolved through the live shell’s exported PATH and environment. The selected executable’s help is queried in the background, and recognized subcommands get their own flag schemas. Requests are deduplicated and cached per session, directory, executable version and environment for ten minutes. All sessions share a budget of two concurrent subprocesses across help discovery, Python inspection, and Bash syntax validation, with at most 64 queued subprocesses. Help probes are each limited to 1.5 seconds and 128 KiB. Suggestion requests have a five-second deadline, including queued work. Disconnected requests release their subscriptions; shared probes continue only while another request still needs them. Only the executable, a recognized subcommand and a help flag are passed to the probe; the user’s argument values are never executed for discovery. Catalog entries are not bulk-executed. Aliases and functions participate in name matching; custom function grammars and complex alias bodies are not inspected. Dynamic script definitions and unrestricted value correction remain unresolved rather than being invented.

Dictation first checks indexed history, then common and already-cached command schemas. A strong candidate that passes validation returns immediately without a help search. Directory repair remains a bounded filesystem lookup. Only when these methods fail does parsing expand referenced paths and search live help. History matching preserves explicit flags and quoted values: `-m "add init commit"` cannot match a historical `. m` or a different message. Bash syntax results are also cached, while file existence is still checked against the current filesystem.

At each prompt, the session prepares its history index and warms a bounded working set: Git’s root metadata, up to ten recent command paths, and common Git/ls routes. Warming follows the same verified help routes as fallback discovery, never executes historical argument values, and stops starting work when discovery is busy. It does not crawl millions of possible combinations. Learned schemas live in session memory for ten minutes, scoped to directory and exported environment, with bounded caches. New commands still work through live discovery when needed.

When ordinary matching has no strong result, compact dictation such as `LSL` is split at each possible character boundary, retaining only real command names and known flags (for example, `ls -l` and `ls -L`). Existing executable names take precedence, and unknown suffixes do not become invented flags. Missing command/option spaces are recovered only at command names that actually exist: `LS-L` can become `ls -l`, while an installed executable named `ls-l` is preserved. For an all-uppercase command name or a missing command/flag boundary such as `ls-L`, matching lowercase flags rank ahead of their uppercase counterparts. Both cases stay available whenever they are known options, regardless of command capitalization. A correctly cased `ls -L` stays `ls -L`. Flags are checked against known schemas and discovered help, including short-option bundles and attached values. Unknown options and incomplete value-taking options remain literal instead of being presented as parsed alternatives. Literal fallback rows are shown once, separately from repairs. Full-command history matches can supply candidates and improve ranking, but must pass the same checks as generated candidates. Distant guesses are omitted instead of padding the menu to three rows. Explicitly referenced directories also supply real filenames beyond the current-directory catalog.

Before displaying a generated candidate, Bash parses it with `--noprofile --norc -n` in a clean environment. This syntax check does not execute the command, substitutions, or redirections. Simple commands also undergo command-name, known subcommand, flag/value, clear required-operand, and applicable input-file/directory checks. A proposed `git init` is never run to validate it. Complex shell expressions receive syntax checking only; custom command semantics, aliases/functions, runtime permissions, network state and program-specific preconditions cannot be proven without execution. The untouched transcript remains available for deliberate use even if it fails these checks. There is no universal side-effect-free dry-run mode for arbitrary commands.

`cd` and `pushd` path repair reads actual directories component by component, starting at the current directory, `/`, or the live shell's home directory for `~`. It follows directory symlinks and matches spoken words against each level's real names: `Cd ~/get/pebble agent` can resolve to `cd ~/git/pebble-agent`. Exact existing components take precedence; files are excluded from directory candidates, spaces are quoted correctly, and failed lookups leave the literal input available. Each request bounds traversal depth, branching and directory reads. This path walk does not execute commands or scan unrelated directory trees. Case-only command matching takes precedence over punctuation normalization, so `Cd` does not become the `_cd` completion function.

Command catalogs refresh when PATH, working directory, alias/function names, or PATH-directory timestamps change, with a two-second fallback. Environment and command files retain parsed snapshots when unchanged. Directory enumeration stops at its entry budgets, and cataloged directory timestamps are checked at new prompts so nearby file changes remain visible. History refreshes reuse parsed entries and unchanged source-file tails. Matching indexes retain normalized names and phonetic forms for each immutable catalog snapshot.

Catalogs and metadata are cached in memory. There is no AI service, speech recording, persistent correction database, global filesystem index, or completion framework integration in this MVP.

## Sessions and reconnects

Shell state and the current directory come from private shell integration records. Inline replacements edit Bash Readline without sending Enter. Each replacement checks both the prompt and the input revision, so a late reply cannot overwrite later keystrokes or enter a running program. Saved command shortcuts also require an idle prompt. Raw terminal input remains available while a program is running.

The server keeps a session alive for up to **one hour after disconnection**. Backgrounding the app releases the output connection so a hidden browser's paused animation frames do not block shell output. Reconnecting to the same running server retains the shell and replays unseen output. Reloads can replay up to the last **2 MiB**, also bounded to 16,384 output chunks to limit small-chunk overhead. This bounded raw replay is not a complete VT snapshot: after truncation, interactive programs may need Ctrl-L or another redraw. The UI calls out truncation.

Commands have request IDs to suppress duplicate delivery within a bounded recent-request cache. Unacknowledged commands and raw keystrokes are **never automatically resent**. A server restart loses live sessions and in-memory metadata/history. One browser tab controls a given session at a time.

## Connect from a phone

Loopback access is the default. For a phone, put the production server behind a trusted HTTPS connection or tunnel. HTTPS is needed for normal PWA installation and browser capabilities on remote hosts.

For example, with an existing HTTPS reverse proxy on the same machine:

```sh
TERMAI_TOKEN='a-long-random-token-of-at-least-24-characters' \
TERMAI_ALLOWED_HOSTS='termai.example.com' \
NODE_ENV=production node server/index.ts
```

Point the proxy at `127.0.0.1:3000`, preserve the `Host` header, and forward WebSocket upgrades. Enter the token in the app's connection screen. For a direct LAN binding, additionally set `HOST=0.0.0.0`; the server requires both an explicit token and allowed hostnames for non-loopback bindings. `TERMAI_ALLOWED_HOSTS` is a comma-separated list of hostnames/IPs without schemes or ports.

The shell runs with your user privileges. The server validates Host and Origin, uses an HttpOnly SameSite session cookie, and requires the configured token before creating a remote session. It is a single-user MVP, without multi-user isolation or an internet-facing account/authentication system.

## Existing local deployment (machine-specific)

The app runs as the enabled user service `termai.service` on **127.0.0.1:7321**. Open **https://omafwchy.taila510b.ts.net/t/** from a device on the tailnet. Tailscale Serve forwards only `/t` to this app; existing routes stay separate.

```sh
systemctl --user status termai
systemctl --user restart termai
journalctl --user -u termai -f
```

The service uses `TERMAI_BASE_PATH=/t` and explicitly allows the tailnet hostname. Assets, API requests, WebSockets, cookies, the manifest and service worker are scoped to `/t/`. This route uses tailnet access rather than an additional application token. To rebuild changes, run `npm run build` and restart the service.

For another subpath deployment, set `TERMAI_BASE_PATH` at runtime and use a reverse proxy that preserves the Host header. Both prefix-preserving and prefix-stripping proxies are supported. Tailscale Serve strips its mount prefix.

## Verify

```sh
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:browser
```

The browser test uses `/usr/bin/chromium` (override with `CHROMIUM=/path/to/chromium`), a loopback server, temporary fixture files and isolated Bash sessions. It covers loading and ready alternatives, real Readline replacement, default tap-to-send with duplicate-tap protection, replacement-only selection, reopenable collapsed menus and saved preferences, incremental mobile composition and ordinary typing, mobile Backspace after dictation and during pending repair, case alternatives, spoken symbols, home-relative directory resolution, completion-helper exclusion, eternal-history context, non-executing validation, late-response cancellation, composition-event deduplication, cached help discovery, Git alias flags and explicit `-m` preservation despite corrupt history, Python inspection, command shortcuts, Ctrl-R, busy guards, current-directory updates, mobile and keyboard-sized layouts, reconnect/offline behavior, authentication, command deduplication, stale edit rejection, and output acknowledgements. Screenshots are saved to `.test-artifacts/`. The README uses full mobile viewport captures, including the terminal, alternatives menus, and shortcut bar, from three simulated dictation regressions. To refresh those images after running `npm run build` and `npm run test:browser`:

```sh
mkdir -p docs/images
cp .test-artifacts/example-{git-init,ls,python}.png docs/images/
```

These fixtures verify termai’s text repair; they do not record audio or benchmark Aqua Voice, Wispr Flow, or a phone keyboard.

Actual Android/iOS dictation, IMEs, touch selection and software-keyboard behavior still need device testing. Browsers do not expose one universal dictation event: the app recognizes multi-character insertions, replacement text and bulk committed compositions; clipboard paste stays raw. Incremental mobile keyboard compositions stream into the terminal as they change, including deletion and correction, rather than going through dictation repair. The hidden keyboard textarea retains a non-output sentinel so mobile keyboards can issue Backspace after text was inserted directly into Bash. Bulk keyboard suggestions and speech may still look identical to the browser. Completion, history navigation, and unrecognized editing sequences suspend automatic repair until the next prompt because the browser no longer knows the exact editable line. Reconnecting to a partially typed line also leaves it untouched. Automated keyboard-size tests simulate viewport changes; they do not emulate an OS keyboard. Linux/Bash is the implemented host target.

The original product conversation is preserved in [initial-spec.md](../initial-spec.md); the user's desires take precedence over its assistant recommendations. The complete benchmark project was moved to **`~/git/termai-benchmark`** before MVP work began; see its `terminal-comparison.md` for the engine decision.
